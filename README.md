##Script for the video
Teacher - Your vocabulary test scores are always low. Are you not studying?
Student - I'm memorizing it by wriing the words, but I lose interest and give up quickly.
Teacher - There's a site called Classcard, why don't you use it for study?
Student - What is it?
-----------------------------------------------------
Teacher - Classcard is a site that will help you learn vocabulary in a more fun way.
It's an internet site that allows you to memorize English words quickly and enjoyably.
Firstly, you can organise your vocabulary learning through three steps: memorise, recall and spell.
Then, you can use ox quizzes and word quiz battles to review the words you've learnt.
You can also find other resources besides the word sets set by your teacher.

Student - Thank you, I'll study hard for next vocabulary test!
