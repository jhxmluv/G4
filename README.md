  Teacher - Your vocabulary test scores are always low. Are you not studying?
  
  Student - I'm memorizing the words by writing them, but I lose interest too quickly, and finally give up.
  
  Teacher - There's a site called Classcard. Why don't you use it for your study?
  
  Student - What is it? How can I use them?

  Teacher
  
  Classcard is a site that will help you learn vocabulary in a more fun way.
  It's an internet site that allows you to memorize English words quickly and enjoyably.
  Firstly, you can organize your vocabulary learning through three steps: memorize, recall, and spell.
  Then, you can use OX quizzes and word quiz battles to review the words you've learnt.
  You can also find other word sets, so please try it!
