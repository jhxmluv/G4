*Scene 1*

Student 1 : After the break, it's a word test, but I don't know many words properly yet.

Student 2 : Me too. I've spent a lot of time this week, and it's still hard.

Student 3 : What should we do? In order to get a score on the test, we have to remember a lot of difficult words...

*Scene 2*

Student 1 : Teacher, I don't remember the spelling and meaning of English words.

Student 3 : Me too. I prepared really hard for the vocabulary test this week.

Teacher : Everyone, seeing that I keep failing the English word test, I think I have a problem with my learning method. 

          To solve this problem, I'll recommend an app called ‚Äòclass card‚Äô. 
          
          This app offers various functions to make English words easier to learn and remember. 
          
          You will get better results on your next test.
