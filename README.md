## Its primary function

### brief overview 
'Classcard' is an online version of flashcard that is often used to memorize words in English class.

### Main features

#### 👤 Individual Learning 

+ **memorization learning**

It is the first stage of learning all the English words you will memorize. After the English words are given, think about the meaning first, and then lower the cover down to make sure the meaning is correct. If it is correct, just put it down and turn it over if you don't know it. After that, only the cards that you don't know continue to appear. There are three methods of memorization: matching the English words given in Korean, and matching English words in the presented English example.

+ **Recall learning**

This the part that matches the Korean meaning in the view after seeing the English word. You can lower the correct answer cover until you get the appropriate answer and then release your hand when you get the correct ansewer. 

+ **Spell learning**

It is the step of looking at the meaning of the word and spelling the word. If you get it wrong or ask for a hint, the card comes out again. You can also match you spelling and pronounciation while listening to word pronounciation.

#### 👥 Group Learning 

+ **Quizz battle**



### Its purpose in English learning or teaching 

This tool makes students enjoy studying English words. Such as quiz battles, It can be participated together, hels students learn repeatedly funny rather than studying alone.

## How to integrate with traditional English word tests using paper

Traditional English words teaching methods involve taking a note test in paper by memorizing English words. And in the process, usually students memorize English words repeating writing or reading alone. However, if you use class cards for studying English words, you can study together by solving quizzes and competing with each other, rather than studying alone. In addition to this, the traditional methods of memorization and recall learning can be learned through digital devices and integrated with them.

### 🎬 detailed scenarios 

Originally, when teachers taught students the spelling and pronunciation of words in class, they studied while writing English words on notes and took tests on paper. However, it can develop into a way to study English words by using the AI application classcard.

| situation | Teachers recommend 'Classcard' that students study English words |
|------| --------------------------------|
| 📌*Scene 1* |
| Student 1 | After the break, it's a word test, but I don't know many words properly yet. |
| Student 2 | Me too. I've spent a lot of time this week, and it's still hard. |
| Student 3 |What should we do? In order to get a score on the test, we have to remember a lot of difficult words... |
| 📌*Scene 2* |
| Student 1 | Teacher, I don't remember the spelling and meaning of English words. |
| Student 3 | Me too. I prepared really hard for the vocabulary test this week. |
| Teacher | Everyone, seeing that I keep failing the English word test, I think I have a problem with my learning method. |
      
          To solve this problem, I'll recommend an app called ‘class card’. 
          
          This app offers various functions to make English words easier to learn and remember. 
          
          You will get better results on your next test.

## How user-friendly is the tool for both teachers and students? 

1. Depending on the publisher of the English textbook, the teacher can add word chapters to the class and set the tests that are presented after the students learn the word chapters. Also, since it is possible to import materials produced by others, even if I do not make them, I can use them in the class.
