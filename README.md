## ‚≠êIts primary function‚≠ê

### brief overview 
'Classcard' is an online version of flashcard that is often used to memorize words in English class.

### Main features

### üë§ Individual Learning 

+ **memorization learning**

It is the first stage of learning all the English words you will memorize. After the English words are given, think about the meaning first, and then lower the cover down to make sure the meaning is correct. There are three methods of memorization: matching the English words given in Korean, and matching English words in the presented English example. 

+ **Recall learning**

This the part that matches the Korean meaning in the view after seeing the English word. 

+ **Spell learning**

It is the step of looking at the meaning of the word and spelling the word.

### üë• Group Learning 

+ **Quizz battle**

Quiz battles are called multiple-choice real-time competition. After checking the teacher's battle code, the student enters the battle code and nickname. Students earn points by solving problems on their personal devices. Various questions such as listening to pronunciation, completing example sentences, and selecting meaning & English words are presented. The hot air balloon on the teacher's screen goes up as the scores are added up for each of the five questions. When the battle is over, you can check the wrong question once more by pressing 'Check the wrong answer' while waiting for the final ranking. In addition, students can know the ranking of the words that have many wrong answers and check the ranking and scores of all students.

### Its purpose in English learning or teaching 

This tool makes students enjoy studying English words. Such as quiz battles, It can be participated together, hels students learn repeatedly funny rather than studying alone.

## How to integrate with traditional English word tests using paper

Traditional English words teaching methods involve taking a note test in paper by memorizing English words. And in the process, usually students memorize English words repeating writing or reading alone. However, if you use class cards for studying English words, you can study together by solving quizzes and competing with each other, rather than studying alone. In addition to this, the traditional methods of memorization and recall learning can be learned through digital devices and integrated with them.

### üé¨ detailed scenarios 

Originally, when teachers taught students the spelling and pronunciation of words in class, they studied while writing English words on notes and took tests on paper. However, it can develop into a way to study English words by using the AI application classcard.

| situation | Teachers recommend 'Classcard' that students study English words |
|------| --------------------------------|
| üìå*Scene 1* |
| Student 1 | After the break, it's a word test, but I don't know many words properly yet. |
| Student 2 | Me too. I've spent a lot of time this week, and it's still hard. |
| Student 3 |What should we do? In order to get a score on the test, we have to remember a lot of difficult words... |
| üìå*Scene 2* |
| Student 1 | Teacher, I don't remember the spelling and meaning of English words. |
| Student 3 | Me too. I prepared really hard for the vocabulary test this week. |
| Teacher | Everyone, seeing that I keep failing the English word test, I think I have a problem with my learning method. |
      
          To solve this problem, I'll recommend an app called ‚Äòclass card‚Äô. 
          
          This app offers various functions to make English words easier to learn and remember. 
          
          You will get better results on your next test.

### üîé How to join 'Classcard'

1. You can download the 'Classcard' app on your phone or tap, or Search for https://www.classcard.net through Google or Naver sites.
2. By clicking on the free membership, you can create simple mail, ID, and password and log in right away.

## unique advantages of using this tool for English learning

Word learning is conducted in the order of memorization, recall, and spelling, and repeated learning is performed in units of sections divided by 10 words. In this process, we can see the unique advantages of class cards. First, in memorization learning, listen to the pronunciation of the current card, lower the cover slightly to confirm the meaning, and then move on to the next card. If you get a card that knows the meaning and pronunciation, lower the cover to the end and mark it as a card that you know. This is because the cards you know can be excluded from the next iteration. If you repeat learning while marking yourself until you mark all the cards in the section, memorization learning is over. Second, in recall learning, you can lower the correct answer cover until you get the appropriate answer and then release your hand when you get the correct ansewer. Third, in spell learning, if you get it wrong or ask for a hint, the card comes out again. You can also match you spelling and pronounciation while listening to word pronounciation.


## How user-friendly is the tool for both teachers and students? 

1. Depending on the publisher of the English textbook, the teacher can add word chapters to the class and set the tests that are presented after the students learn the word chapters. Also, since it is possible to import materials produced by others, even if I do not make them, I can use them in the class.

2. Students can join the class created by the teacher as soon as they enter the invitation code sent by the teacher. Students take the test after learning, and when they complete it, it is automatically submitted to the teacher, so the teacher can immediately check the student's word learning level and test score in real time on the report tab without directly calculating it. If you have taken the test several times, you can also check in detail the score by order and the amount of learning at the time the test was submitted.

3. The teacher can assign homework to the students. When entering the learning & test setting on the app, the teacher can immediately save it by clicking on the learning to be given as homework and entering the type or target score of the test question.
   
## Interactive features that the tool offer to engage students

### üéÆ Quiz battle

Students can take an online quiz. They can access the quiz battle site on devices such as tablets and laptops and enter the battle code shared by the teacher. They can take the quiz and their scores increase in real-time by entering the code and name on the site where the teacher created the questions in advance. Therefore, students can improve Their English skills by simply enjoying quiz games.

+ Example

A teacher can prepare for group activities using a class card. After dividing the group into several groups, students can do an online quiz battle on the class card app with the English words they learned in this class and do activities such as which group has higher quiz battle scores. Through this, students will be able to participate better in class.
