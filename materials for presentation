### How to use “classcard”
1. memorization learning
   It is the first stage of learning all the English words you will memorize.
   After the English words are given, think about the meaning first, and then lower the cover down to make sure the meaning is correct. 
   If it is correct, just put it down and turn it over if you don't know it. 
   After that, only the cards that you don't know continue to appear.
   There are three methods of memorization: matching the meaning of English words, matching the English words given in Korean, and matching English words in the presented English example.

2. Recall Learning
   This is the part that matches the Korean meaning in the view after seeing the English word.
   You can lower the correct answer cover until you get the appropriate answer and then release your hand when you get the correct answer.

3. Spell learning
   It is the step of looking at the meaning of the word and spelling the word. 
   If you get it wrong or ask for a hint, the card comes out again. 
   You can also match your spelling and pronunciation while listening to word pronunciation.
